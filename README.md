# USBCameraToWebRTC
Trying to create magic.
Here is a Android module with C++ sources of AndroidUsbCamera https://github.com/jiangdongguo/AndroidUSBCamera (2.3.1) and saki's USBCamera https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera (last)
Before pass to WebRTC you should convert video to property format via LibYUV. 
USB -> libYUV -> WebRTC
P.S. Just for first star)
